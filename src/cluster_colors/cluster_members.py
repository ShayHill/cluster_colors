"""Members of a cluster represented as a list of vectors with a proximity matrix.

The clustering algorithms in this package do not calculate proximity, but only refer
to a given proximity matrix. This means that more expensive proximity calculations
can be used with the minimum penalty. Each Supercluster and the Clusters it contains
share a single Members instance. This instance holds all vector information and a few
variants of the proximity matrix. A Cluster is defined by the indices of the members
it contains.
